            <p class="intro text-left">
Throughout history, women have faced unique challenges when attempting to enter into leadership roles.  There are also, however, a few rare examples of brave women who chose to break the mold and change the lives of others through their effective leadership, despite the people and societal restrictions that told them they would never succeed.<br>  <br>
As both a woman and an aspiring community leader, I have always been drawn to these stories and wondered what made these pioneering female leaders so different from other women who were content to simply accept (and, on occasion, even protect and defend) the status quo.  My fascination with these women and their stories is likely the result of a desperate search for a mentor, a desire to find another woman with similar passions and drives as my own, someone who had gone before me to brave the waters and defy the odds.<br>  <br>
I found the mentor I was searching for in Ella Brennan, a restauranteur and culinary entrepreneur from New Orleans, who has spent her life utilizing the principles of servant leadership to encourage, and inspire those around her to greatness. <br>  <br>
	Ella Brennan was born in the Irish Channel neighborhood of New Orleans in 1925. An area well-known for its ruffians and other assorted “riff-raff” of society, the Brennan’s were largely immune to the negative impacts of living in a rough neighborhood while Ella was growing up.  She recalls how her father loved baseball and boxing, and her mother lived for singing, entertaining, and, most importantly: cooking. (Muellener)<br>  <br>
Ella would later go on to say that the best cooks have “…magic in their hands…” (McNulty) and she firmly believed that her mother had the most magical hands of all.  Her mother’s love of cooking and gastronomy instilled in the Brennan children a deep love of all things culinary.  <br>  <br>
Despite being Irish immigrants, Ella’s mother embraced the uniquely New Orleans French Creole culture around her.  She loved to cook red beans and rice, stuffed peppers and redfish court bouillon. Friday night specialties often involved oysters, shrimp, and soft-shelled crab, all cooked to order for every person at the table. (Mullener) Ella’s mother treated her family and her guests with a distinct servant leadership mentality, and it is quite likely that this early influence would be a factor in the later development of Ella’s own servant leadership style as she progressed in her career.<br>  <br>
In the early 1940’s, Ella Brennan was preparing to graduate from McMain High School in New Orleans, LA.  While most women her age were focused on fulfilling stereotypical “woman’s duties” of the day (centered around finding a husband and starting a family), (Collier) Ella’s life would take a different path entirely.  <br>  <br>
Although she contemplated college, she ultimately decided to enroll in business school.  While the concept of business school today conjures up ideas of a solid business education with foundations in economics, statistics, management and marketing, the business school in Ella’s day was “…typing, filing, [and] shorthand – [it was a place] where you could learn to work for a man." (Mullener)<br>  
In what could easily be described as an ironic twist of fate, it was around the beginning of Ella’s second semester in “business school” that her older brother, Owen, purchased a restaurant in the French Quarter of New Orleans called The Vieux Carre.  Arnaud Cazenave (founder of the legendary New Orleans restaurant Arnaud’s) was reported to have laughed at Owen when he purchased the business, telling him that there was no possible scenario in which the business could be successful.  He made a very public statement that “…an Irishman cannot cook French food.” (Iwerks, Commanding) While Owen was interested in proving him wrong, by all accounts, he did not get off to a strong start.<br>  
Ella remembers back to the days of Vieux Carre with a seemingly paradoxical sentiment of both affection and distaste.  She remembers fondly that “…being exposed to all those different people…” at Vieux Carre was “…one of the most exciting things a kid that age could have experienced,” and it profoundly shaped the people-oriented service model she would carry with her throughout her life and career. (Iwerks, Commanding)<br>  <br> 
 	However, while it was the beginning of the long journey that would later go on to largely define her life, she also remembers: <br> <br>  
		"It was a terrible restaurant - Very limited. Not exciting.  I was complaining so<br>   			much that Owen finally asked me: If you’re so goddam smart, why<br>   don't you 			come do something about it?" (Mullener) <br>  <br> 
Owen had little interest in handling the day to day affairs of the business and was quite happy to have Ella waiting in the wings, excitedly willing and eager to take over the responsibilities.  As a result, he placed the responsibility for everything - from hiring and firing staff, planning menus, keeping and stocking inventory, even paying the bills - all squarely onto Ella’s young shoulders.<br>  
The 1940s in New Orleans was the beginning of a bustling food culture scene that continues to this day.  Legendary restaurant names such as Arnaud’s, Galatoire’s, Broussad’s and Antoine’s had all taken up shop in the French Quarter and business was booming.  Ella would stand outside Vieux Carre, looking at the lines of people waiting to get into her competitor’s restaurants and wonder why her own was not experiencing the same level of enthusiasm.  <br>  <br> 
During one particular incident, when the sight of her own empty tables contrasted against the crowds of her competitors had her feeling especially distraught, Ella was forced to realize just how inexperienced and ill-equipped she really was for the position she had been thrust into.  Her father said to her: <br>  <br>  
	“Well, don’t just stand there feeling sorry for yourself - what are you going to do<br>     			about it?” (Iwerks, Commanding) <br>  <br>  
It is reasonably safe to assume that many women in the 1940s (who fell prey to the social stigmas and norms of the day) may have decided that walking away was the best answer. The prevailing social ideas of the time had determined that the “unsavory” world of business was entirely inappropriate for women’s gentle and frail natures. (Kwolek-Folland) <br>  <br>  
Miss Ella, however, was not the average 1940s woman and she refused to be beaten so easily.  Her son, Alex Brennan, would later recall:<br>  
	“Our childhood was normal - except our mom was working.  At that time, nobody<br>  		- and I mean nobody - else’s mom was working.” (Iwerks,  Commanding)<br>  <br>  
Miss Ella (who had earned the nickname “Hurricane Ella”) learned not only to survive, but to excel and thrive as a leader in a male-dominated field that would not go on to address gender inequality as a mainstream issue until decades later.<br>  <br>  
Many years later, Sue Zemanick would look back on the atmosphere surrounding women in the professional world (the professional culinary world, in particular) when she took her first job as a line cook at Ella Brennan’s restaurant Commander’s Palace:<br><br>  
	“When I first started, you would hardly ever see another woman in the kitchen,<br>   	  		much less running the show.  Working at a restaurant with such a strong woman 		<br>  	in charge gave me hope that I could make it, too.”  (Anderson)<br>  <br>  
Early on in Ella’s career, she made an important realization that would set her on a course for the rest of her life, becoming a key factor not only in her own success but in the that success that she would go on to foster in others: knowledge is power.  She began reading every book, every newspaper, every written work of any sort that she could get her hands on: cookbooks, business books, periodicals to understand the global climate and popular culture. Ella became a proverbial sponge for the information that she gathered through her readings.<br>  <br>  
While books would prove to be vital to Ella’s personal and professional growth, it was far from the only form of intellectual capital she acquired in her early days at Vieux Carre.  She also began speaking to others more informed than herself.  “...Anyone who might have something to teach her, anyone who would put up with her endless questions…” became a target for her inquisitive nature.  She was quick to talk to sophisticated diners, the wine merchants she purchased from, and even pulled up a stool in the kitchen every hour so she could talk to the cooks. (Mullener)<br>  <br>  
Ella attached herself at the hip to one of her first chefs, a man by the name of Paul Blangé, who (like nearly all of the people under Ella’s leadership throughout her life) would later go on to become a legend in the culinary world.  Even though he was technically her subordinate, she was wise enough to know that there was still plenty he could teach her, and she gratefully soaked it in:<br>  
	“I would sit there and ask him, and he would give me everything he could give<br>   	  		me.  He’d show me how to butcher a tenderloin, how to fillet a fish. Then <br>    he’d 			give me the invoice and say, ‘Here’s what it cost us; here’s what we have to get 	<br>  	 	out of it. It was a fantastic learning experience.’ (McNulty)<br>  <br>  
In 1954, Owen leased another building at 417 Royal Street – an old, decrepit, run-down joint that had been used to house military personnel during the War.  He was determined to turn it into a first-rate establishment capable of holding its own against the other culinary giants in New Orleans.  Owen brought the entire Brennan family into the venture (except their mother who, considering herself a fine, respectable Irishwoman, refused to have anything to do with the French Quarter).  It was in that moment that the now famous Brennan’s was born.<br>  
	Plans immediately got under way for the new family business, with each member contributing equal effort and input relative to their own areas of expertise.  Then, less than a year after signing the lease, tragedy struck.  Owen died in his sleep of a massive heart attack at just 45 years of age. (Price)<br>  <br>  
Ella, already dealing with the grief and devastation of losing her beloved brother so unexpectedly, was not about to watch his dream – the family’s dream – die as well.  Seeing the gaping hole in leadership that her brother had left behind, she stepped up to the plate and did what had to be done to keep the business on track.<br>  <br>  
Unfortunately, the rest of the world did not see Ella as the determined restauranteur, self-educated entrepreneur or brilliant business mind that she really was.  Instead, they saw her as a woman with a famous, deceased brother and little more.  In fact, immediately after her brother’s death, the bank pulled the financing on Brennan’s and refused to follow through with the original loan, nervous at the prospect of financing a business with a woman in charge. (Iwerks, Commanding)  <br>  <br>  
This was not the first roadblock Ella had faced as a result of being a woman in a leadership position at a time when that notion was dangerously unpopular, and unfortunately, it would not be the last.   However, she would later credit the empowering, servant leadership style that she has become so well-known for today to those early days of rejection, exclusion and struggle. (Anderson) <br>  <br>  
In an interview in 2009, Ella recalls: <br>  <br>  
	"Pip and Dick (her surviving brothers) were in the Army, John was in the Navy<br>   		  	and Dottie had just gotten married, so I had to open the restaurant.<br>      I got that place 		open by the seat of my pants – but I got it open.” (Mullener) <br> <br>   
True to her nature, Ella saw what needed to be done, and then worked relentlessly to make it happen.<br> <br>  
While the bankers may have been worried about a woman-run establishment, Ella’s community knew better.  She was one of them and had always prided herself on that fact.  They loved and respected her immensely.  Everyone involved in the reconstruction and opening of the building (including contractors and construction crews) were far from intimidated by the notion of a woman being in charge (at least, not if that woman was Miss Ella Brennan).  <br>  <br>  
They weren’t just speaking empty words to comfort a grieving sister when they offered their support to her. They followed through, letting their money and effort back up their emotional support of Ella, electing to defer payments for their work until Brennan’s was up and running, and the family had time to regain their footing.  (Mullener)<br>  <br>  
In fact, the entire community of New Orleans’ French Quarter took Ella in under their wing after Owen’s death and helped to get Brennan’s open.  When opening day finally arrived, everyone came together to help them move from Vieux Carre down the street to Brennan’s.  <br>  <br>  
Ella remembers that it was done “…hilariously incorrectly…”, with people carrying chairs, bar stools, and pots and pans on their heads down the street.  What was supposed to be a one-day move, instead became an impromptu, month-long Mardi Gras-esque party.  New Orleans had embraced Ella and the Brennan label.  The business was a success from day one, debts began to disappear, and Ella Brennan had become an inseparable part of New Orleans community and culture.<br>  <br>  
The opening of Brennan’s was such an outlandishly extravagant event that the national media finally caught word.  The occasion was covered with headlines that read “Girl Restauranteur” by Life magazine, The Sunday Evening Post, McCall’s and Holiday, just to name a few. (Mullener) Laughing in the face of the bankers who refused to give a loan to a woman-run business, Brennan’s under Ella’s leadership had become one of the most notorious and well-known restaurants not just in New Orleans, but in the entire United States.<br>   <br>   
There were many factors that enabled and encouraged Ella’s enormous and unprecedented success. She was a lifelong learner, determined and stubborn, and she had the support of her friends, family and community behind her.  The argument can be made, however, that her insistence on using a servant leadership model was the most vitally important factor of all.  <br>  <br>  
Servant leadership is a concept as old as the written word.  There are references to the concept in the Bible, when Jesus says: <br>  <br>  

	“…whoever wants to become great among you must be a servant, and whoever<br>   			wants to be first must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not<br>    come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”  (NIV, Mark 10:42-45) <br>  <br>  
Even before Christ, in the sixth century BC, Lao-tsu often referenced a leadership style quite similar to servant leadership.  Though there are many different translations of Lao-tsu’s work, “…one can see if not hear in practically all of them, between the lines, the early concept of servant leadership with the ideals of listening to others, caring for them, and putting their concerns first…” (Valeri, 15) Even Plato spoke of a similar leadership style when he wrote: “…any genuine ruler really is incapable of considering his own welfare, rather than that of his subject…” (Plato, Republic)<br>  <br>  
While the ideals of servant leadership are timeless and classic, it wasn’t until Robert K. Greenleaf wrote his groundbreaking essay The Servant as Leader in 1970 that the idea reached modern mainstream consciousness.  In his essay, Greenleaf discusses the idea that “…the workplace was not [meant to be] only a learning institution, but an avenue for personal growth and fulfillment.” (Boyum) He describes the philosophy of a servant-leader as:	<br>  <br>  
	“…a servant first… It begins with the natural feeling that one <br>    					wants to serve…then conscious choice brings one to aspire to<br>    lead…Care [is] 			taken by the servant-first to make sure that other people’s<br>   highest priority needs 			are being served.  The best test, and<br>   difficult to administer, is: Do those served 			grow as persons? Do<br>    they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, 			more<br> <br>    autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants? And, what is the<br>   		 	effect on the least privileged in society? Will they benefit or at least not be 			further deprived?” (Greenleaf)<br>  <br>  
In all of his works, but The Servant as Leader in particular, Greenleaf stresses the need for a better approach to leadership than the traditional model of the time, one that puts serving others - including employees, customers, and community - as the number one priority. Servant-leadership emphasizes increased service to others, a holistic approach to work, and promoting a sense of community. (Spears)<br>  <br>  
Ella instinctively understood the importance of community in her leadership style. It has been proven that people thrive when they are in communities, when they feel a sense of belonging to a group and a calling to something larger than themselves. (Peterson) The best servant-leaders try to identify a way to build community among those who work within a group or institution. (Casterlow) 
While being interviewed for Commanding the Table, Ella pointed out that her success could largely be attributed to her natural understanding of these principles: <br>  <br>  
	“[It is] very personal business.  That’s what it’s all about - treating your customers<br>   		like they’re your family, or a close friend coming to your house. <br>    We want 			people who eat here to feel important, and we want them to<br>   have fun.”<br> <br> 
In fact, seemingly anyone who has ever worked under Ella remembers her personal mantra well: ‘Pay attention, taste everything, and above all else, think of the customer in anything you’re doing.’ (McNulty) The entire service model of Vieux Carre, Brennan’s and later the legendary Commander’s Palace, was based completely on making the customer feel valued, comfortable and important.  <br>  <br>  
In any endeavor that Miss Ella has ever undertaken, she believed that “…slow, gracious courtesy is more important than anything - except maybe your mama, eating and jazz.” (O’Neill)<br>  <br>  
Joe Henican, board member for Commander’s Palace, points out just how intense Ella’s desire to ensure that her customers have an unforgettably perfect time has always been:
	“You sit down at lunch with her and she looks around, and within 30 seconds, she 		has called somebody over to say, ‘Table 57 needs water,’ or ‘button your coat,’ or 		‘that table is wobbly’.<br>  <br>  
Ruth Reichl of Gourmet magazine says that she can never forget her first trip to Commander’s Palace in 1980:<br>  <br>  
	“It was the most extraordinary service I'd ever had in an American restaurant.  We 		were used to going to fancy restaurants and having a guy with a French accent 			look down his nose because you weren't pronouncing [the food names] right.  But 			you went to Commander's Palace and it wasn't like that. It was like, ‘we're here to 			make sure you have a good time’.” (Mullener)<br>  <br>  
While the sense of community that Ella promotes is what most draws me to her story on a personal level, without a doubt, the thing that she is best known for is the transformative way that she inspires, encourages and compels everyone around her to strive for their own personal excellence.<br>  <br>  
As an example of this mentality, Ella noted in a 2016 interview that:<br>  <br>  
	 “…You have to make people feel like they’re valued.  If they feel that, they’ll do 			their best. And what you want from people is their best, whatever that is for 			them.” (McNulty) <br> <br>   
She also expressed a similar sentiment in the 2016 documentary Ella Brennan: Commanding the Table when she described how she, as a woman, tackled the difficult task of earning the respect of her male chefs and staff: <br>  
	“It’s a mutual respect.  [The] first thing you have to do is show these guys 				respect. You admire them, you appreciate what they’re doing. When you develop 			that type of relationship with someone, they open up and feel free to do their best 			work.”<br>  <br>  
While many people (particularly in leadership positions) might feign interest in others simply as a means to an end, Ella’s desire to help others has always come from a place of genuine concern and care – and the people around her noticed.  <br>  <br>  
Xavier Texiedo (former chairman of the National Restaurant Association who worked as a manager under Ella at Commander’s Palace from 1981 until 1984) says that Ella “…is just masterful at crafting people to reach their potential,” and credits his entire career to the genuine interest she took in encouraging him to always strive to be his best self. (McNulty) <br>  <br>  
One of the ways that she fostered this excellence in others was not only by encouraging, but even mandating, that her staff actively participate in the decision-making process at all of her establishments.  By doing so, she made sure that they helped shape the direction of both the business and their own individual growth in the process.  Dickie Brennan, Ella’s nephew points out:<br>  <br>  
	“She (Ella) was a generation ahead of her time in the idea of empowering and 			including your people.  That’s how she got the best out of people, and that’s 			why she has the [successful and notable] alumni that she does.” (McNulty)<br>  <br>  
Before Ella was willing to allow her staff to take the reins in decision-making, however, she also made sure that they were as educated and informed as she was.  Chef Emeril Lagasse first broke into the culinary world while serving under Ella at Commander’s Palace and remembers that:<br>  <br>  
	 “She didn’t just hand over the wand and say, ‘Change what you want’. I had to 			prove myself before I could get a little window on the menu. She managed 			somehow to be authoritative without being authoritarian. She’s extremely 				demanding but not difficult to work for.” (McNulty) <br>  <br>  
	“Every day, Ella was pushing you, making you laugh, making you better, more 			responsive to the world, less a prisoner of yourself.” (O’Neill)<br>  <br>  
Lagasse would later go on to become America’s first celebrity chef and one of the most well-known names in the modern culinary world, citing Ella’s guidance as the single most-important factor in his ultimate success. (Iwerks, Commanding)<br>  <br>  
Well-aware of how much her own professional life had been shaped by her never-ending quest for knowledge, she encouraged those who worked for her to do the same.  Greenleaf points out in The Servant as Leader that a key component of successful leadership is for a leader to “…encourage their [the people they lead’s] growth and development so that over time they may reach their fullest potential.” (Greenleaf) <br> <br>   
Later findings on the efficacy of servant leadership from research done separately by Robert C. Liden and Dirk van Dierendonck confirmed the importance of empowering, helping subordinates grow and succeed, and providing them with guidance and direction, not only for an individual’s growth but for that of organizations and institutions. (Keith)<br>  <br>  
Ella Brennan fulfilled these duties beautifully by freely and enthusiastically sharing her vast wealth of knowledge with others, and continuously encouraging them to do the same for themselves. It was a frequent practice of Ella’s to hand out books to her subordinates on any topic ranging from cooking to management to communication that she (or they) felt would be beneficial to them and fuel their personal growth.  <br>  <br>  
Jorge Henriquez, now director of operations for Dickie Brennan and Co., was overwhelmed and more than a little star struck when he first came to work for Ella as kitchen manager of Commander’s Palace in 1992:<br>  <br>  
	“I came in as a relatively young guy, thinking, ‘What could I possibly contribute 			to a place like this?’  But she was always very open-minded with people. Her 			approach was: ‘Don’t reinvent the wheel, but if you can do something better, go 			ahead and show me, and we’ll use it.’” (McNulty)<br>  <br>  
Yet another former employee, Kate Ezell, remembers her time with Ella similarly:<br>  <br>  
	“She was always about pursuing excellence, but it was never at your expense. It 			was the idea that if she knew something, and we’re working together, then it’s 			better for everyone if she shares that with you.” (McNulty)<br>  <br>  
She took an immense amount of pride and joy from her mentoring duties, and to this day, anyone who served under her leadership always remembers their time spent with Ella (especially time spent one-on-one) as the most pivotal and influential moments in their careers.  Her leadership in that respect was very motherly and selflessly nurturing.  She knew that she was raising great chefs who would one day want to “fly the nest” and go out into the world to start their own culinary empires:<br>  <br>  
	“That [the restaurant] was a school.  The most important part of my job was being 		a teacher.  When you run a restaurant, if the people who work for you are any 			good at it, they’ll want to leave and start their own…and you help them.  It’s what 		you do.” (Mullener)<br>  <br>  
In Greenleaf’s The Servant Leader, he states that one of the defining traits of an effective servant leader is whether or not the people they lead/serve are “…more likely themselves to become servants.”  In this final test, Ella Brennan shines yet again.  Every individual who has worked for her has gone on to say that her transformative servant-leadership stayed with them long after they’d started their own businesses; they are now servant-leaders themselves as a result of her example.  Kate Ezell states, “That’s always the way I want to work with people now.” (McNulty)<br>  <br>  
Emeril Lagasse echoes a similar sentiment while remembering a time in Ella’s kitchen when he got caught up in the chaos and lost his cool.  Instead of yelling or kicking him out of the kitchen, Ella walked up to him and handed him a folded-up note, telling him to read it that night after work:<br>  <br>  
	“Of course, I had to read it right then.  It said, ‘Do me a favor and leave your ego 			at home.’ It made me realize - I didn’t have to operate like this. I can operate by 			being a leader, by being a teacher, leading by example.  To this day, that’s how I 			run my kitchen, and I have Ella to thank for it.” (Iwerks, Commanding)<br>  <br>  
The people who have had the pleasure of working directly with Ella all remember her as the same powerful influence on their lives.  However, in the tradition of truly great and effective leadership, her story has begun to impact people who have never even met her.<br>  <br>  
Six months ago, I was lost and confused.  Having a solid academic record and the personal drive to accomplish anything I set my mind too, I was overwhelmed by the range of possibilities available for my own life.  I knew what I loved and where my passions in life were focused, but I lacked a sense of confidence that I could ever turn them into anything even remotely tangible or successful. I had convinced myself that I could never make a living from my interests because I had never seen it done.<br>  <br>  
Then I found Ella Brennan, and in her story, I saw pieces of myself, a roadmap for the journey that I want to take in life.  I found in her the fearless woman leader I had been so desperate to find; a woman who taught everyone around her to take pride in themselves and their cultural roots, preserving communities through a servant mindset.  <br>  <br>  
Seeing her example has made me realize that it is absolutely possible to succeed as a woman in leadership.  However, it is also a responsibility that I and all other women have inherited to the young girls who will come after us (including my own two daughters) to be the representation of what they will think is possible for them.<br>  <br>  
A week into writing this paper, with a few deep breaths and more than a few lingering reservations, I laid the foundational groundwork for my own business. I’m not sure that I would have ever found the courage to take the leap and become a woman entrepreneur or an aspiring servant leader within my community without the example of hard work and perseverance set by a woman I have never met.  A stranger from my grandmother’s generation has inspired me to fearlessly follow my own dreams of leadership, and in the words of author and philosopher Matshona Dhliwayo:<br>  <br>  
“The real power of a leader is in the number of minds (s)he can reach,
hearts (s)he can touch, souls (s)he can move, 
and lives (s)he can change.” <br>  <br>
