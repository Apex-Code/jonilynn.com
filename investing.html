  For some people, this term brings up images of rags to riches and flipping an exorbitant profit that leads them to unbelievable wealth.  For others, the term brings up images of overly-optimistic stock market noobs who will never see wealth because they invest their capital in risky ventures instead of sure things.  <br><br>
  As with most things in life, the truth about penny stocks isn’t found in either end of the extremes but somewhere in the middle.  So how does a new or aspiring investor know whether to invest in the latest hot tip penny stock or run screaming for the hills?<br><br>
  Let’s start with a brief introduction to the concept of penny stocks.  Here is the academic definition I found for a penny stock:<br><br>
    “A penny stock typically trades outside of the major market exchanges at a relatively       low price and has a small market capitalization. These stocks are generally considered      highly speculative and high risk because of their lack of liquidity, large bid-ask spreads,       small capitalization and limited following and disclosure.” (Investopedia)<br><br>
  For most of us who are new to the stock market or just starting to consider joining the Wall Street circus, that definition warrants a one-word response: “Huh?”<br><br>
  So, what does all of that mumbo-jumbo about small market capitalization, liquidity and large bid-ask spreads mean in layman’s terms?<br><br>
  Essentially, penny stocks should be seen by individual investors (that’s us) “…like Wall Street's Wild West, an untamed world of investing detached from all the glitz and media coverage that comes with stocks that are traded on major exchanges.” (The Street)  <br><br>
  A commonly accepted definition for a penny stock is that it is any stock traded at less than $5 a share (and despite the misnomer, they rarely actually cost a penny).  While you can find a few of these on the major exchanges, they generally have to be found (and sold) through other means.<br><br>
  The drawbacks to purchasing penny stocks include the fact that they are not frequently traded so finding a buyer when you’re ready to sell will likely be more difficult than with larger, more established stocks.  Also, it can be difficult to find accurate price valuations for these stocks making it harder to know their true value.  These two factors combined means that when buying penny stocks you could end up with a bunch of valueless stock that you can’t find a buyer for.  Did you know that a broker can’t even sell you a penny stock without the legal obligation of sending you a document to tell you how risky they are? (The Street)<br><br>
  Another risk of penny stocks is that they provide the prime environment for scammers to steal your money.  Many shell companies (or companies that are incorporated but don’t actually have any business activities) use penny stocks as a means for schemes like the infamous pump and dump scam (read my blog post HERE for more about pump and dump schemes).  <br><br>
  So, with all of these clearly present risks involved, why do some investors still fall for the allure of penny stocks?  For those of us who don’t have thousands of dollars to buy stock in Apple or Google, there is the potential for HUGE profits if the trade works out in our favor (IF being the inescapable key word there).
  And how should a potential investor judge whether or not a penny trade is more likely than not to end favorably for them?  <br><br>
  <strong>By doing your homework.</strong><br><br>
  <strong>DO NOT</strong> listen if someone tells you they have a hot tip on a penny stock (see my   aforementioned post on <a href="../blog/pennystocks.html"> PUMP AND DUMP scams)</a>.<br><br>
  <strong>DO NOT</strong> treat penny stocks like lottery tickets or slot machines.  <br><br>
  <strong>DO</strong> your research.  Look for companies that are posting solid gains over a long period of time.<br><br>
  <strong>DO NOT</strong> listen to your favorite penny stock guru or their newsletter.  They are almost always  paid endorsements from companies trying to get exposure for their stock, and NOT looking out  for you and your money.<br><br>
  <strong>DO</strong> sell quickly if you feel the earnings potential is there (don’t get greedy and risk losing your  chance at a quick profit…that’s the whole appeal of penny stocks, after all!)<br><br>
  Writing for Market Watch, Michael Sincere sums it up perfectly, so I will default to his greater expertise as my concluding point:<br><br>
    “They don’t cost much money and promise big profits. But trading penny stocks is also a good way to lose money.  Sure, it’s possible to profit when you understand the game, but the odds are against you when you don’t…Every penny stock company wants you think it has an exciting story that will revolutionize the world. If you enter the penny stock arena, be cynical, do your own research, and diversify, even if a friends or family  member is touting a stock. Penny stocks have earned their bad reputation, so beware.”<br><br>
