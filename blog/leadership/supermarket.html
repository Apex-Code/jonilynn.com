            <h2 class = "text-center header">Learning to lead the hard way </h2><br>
           
                <p class="intro text-left">I got my first job at a local Price Chopper supermarket in Upstate NY when I was 15 years old.  It was common for high school and college kids in my hometown to get their foot in the door of the grownup employment world at this particular supermarket.  I started (as most kids do) as a bagger, and within a month, had worked my way up to cashier.  I was fortunate to have two very hard-working parents as a child, so I took the work ethic that they instilled in me and applied it thoroughly to my first job.  I was never sick or late, I never said no to a task…during one particularly bad blizzard, I was one of just 3 cashiers who showed up to work at all (and I had to walk a mile in the snow to get there by 6am!).<br><br>
My pursuit of excellence paid off for me on a personal level.  It led to me being transferred to the video department (an upgrade, despite how it sounds) after just eight months, and then to Customer Service after a year.  After six months in Customer Service, I became the Customer Service manager.  At barely 17 years old, I had gone from grocery bagger to Customer Service Manager.  I was making a lot of terrible decisions in my personal life at the time and my pursuit of excellence in my job was really my only source of pride back then.  <br><br>
However, my meteoric rise to glory in the small-town NY supermarket scene, was not so well-received with my teammates.  People who were older and more experienced than me were angry that I had been given so many promotions so quickly.  Half of my teammates, subordinates and superiors loved me…the other half couldn’t stand me.  This made it very difficult to work alongside others and often caused problems with team efficiency (as it would turn out, it’s difficult to manage people who don’t respect you).  People saw me as a “goody-two-shoes” and no one took me seriously; our front-end work suffered as a result of our lack of unity.  At the time, I didn’t care whether or not people liked me – I was there to do the best job that I could and I couldn’t be bothered with popularity contests.  Looking back, I can see how that attitude negatively affected the actual work we were supposed to be doing.<br><br>
In hindsight, I can’t/don’t blame anyone for not taking me seriously.  I wouldn’t have taken 17-year-old me seriously, either!  I was a know-it-all who thought rising up through the ranks of my local grocery store was the first step in world domination.  Knowing what I know now, I was epically and fantastically wrong but the experience was instrumental in turning me into the (slightly) wiser person that I am today.<br><br>
