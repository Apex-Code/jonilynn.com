            <!-- <h2 class = "text-center header">That one follow up to the lead in...</h2><br> -->
           
            <p class="intro text-left">I was recently asked to consider a time when I held a fixed mindset.  That could not be an easier task for me since I unortunately live in a semi-permanent fixed mindset (a realization that I hadn’t previously made until reading this chapter).  While my logical mind realizes that just about everything falls into various shades of “grey area”, everything in my emotional mind tends to instinctively jump to some form of a black-white dichotomous catastrophe.<br><br>
  I have struggled with anxiety and health anxiety (hypochondria) since I was a child.  Growing up, I heard many stories about my paternal grandmother who had passed away when I was only a year old; at age 45, she dropped dead of a massive heart attack while hanging laundry on the line.  Then, when I was 9 years old, my dad suffered a heart attack (he was only 32) and I was deeply affected by seeing him in a hospital bed.  Looking at the situation logically, I believe these early experiences (combined with being raised by a mother whose entire life perspective is the textbook definition of a fixed mindset) imprinted an “either-or” mentality on my brain.  <br><br>
  I was interested to learn that people are generally quite terrible at estimating their abilities (with fixed mindset individuals being especially inept).1   In a similar manner, people who experienced a traumatic illness (especially at young ages), have their brains “…wrongly tag the event as being much more likely to occur again. Probability gets all mixed up with possibility… “2 oftentimes resulting in hypochondria.<br><br>
  For example, I am not able to simply feel and ignore the daily aches and pains that everyone assures me are part of the normal human condition.  Instead, my brain (following its usual fixed mindset), assumes every minute discomfort is a sign of an impending heart attack.  The pain in my jaw, the pain in my arm, or the heart palpitations are all signs that I am going to drop dead any second.  <br><br>
  Over the years, I have started to learn to change my mindset (at least regarding health anxiety) to more of a growth perspective.  I have to remind myself that the pain in my jaw is more likely to be from clenching my teeth together as an anxiety response.  The pain in my arm is because I sleep on my arm every night and rest too much weight on it during the day.  Heart palpitations are a completely benign and normal event that everyone experiences, but I notice more because of my heightened sensitivity to my body (also, increased stress levels and eating junk food can cause increases in their frequency).  <br><br>
  Through my own personal experience, it’s clear to me that a fixed mindset is not the healthiest, sanest or best option.  In fact, it is completely counterintuitive to a happy, peaceful life.  The stress that a fixed mindset causes is exhausting, and I hope that I will someday be able to say I have fully-adopted a growth mentality.<br><br>
