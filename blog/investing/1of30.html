            <h2 class = "text-center header">By T. Harv Eker<br />
           
            <p class="intro text-left">
  The first book in my <strong>30 Financial Books in 30 Days</strong> project was Secrets of the Millionaire Mind by T. Harv Eker.  Eker begins the book by delving into how your upbringing creates a personal money blueprint that subconsciously directs your financial present and future.  I had no problem getting behind this notion because it’s precisely why I suffered with financial irresponsibility (and the resultant financial devastation) for the first decade of my adult life, and subsequently why I was able to teach myself how to change it.  <br><br>
Following Eker’s example, I decided to write this week’s 30 in 30 about teaching financial responsibility to our children.  As a parent myself, I worry incessantly about the impact that my child rearing will have on my children’s future financial life.  <br><br>
The following are my top five tips for making sure you are raising fiscally responsible children:<br><br>
1. <strong>Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them. -James Baldwin</strong><br><br>
Children learn what they see.  If you model responsible fiscal behavior, your children will be more likely to follow suit.  Do you budget?  Do you invest?  Do you teach your kids about money and how to effectively manage it?  Or do you live paycheck to paycheck, spend on impulse purchases, and never have anything in your emergency fund?  Is money treated as something precious to be protected, something that provides for your freedom and security?  Or is it treated frivolously, viewed as fleeting and unattainable by all but the greediest?  Your actions (and your words) will reverberate through generations – so choose wisely.<br><br>

2. Consider giving your kids an allowance that they work for.  Be prepared that your kids won’t like having chores any more than we did at their age, but the life lessons they will learn they will carry with them for years to come.  If your children are teens, consider getting them a prepaid ATM card, and teach them to budget and track their spending (and their savings!). Even better than allowance?  Let your kids work for commission!  Rather than just doing the bare minimum to put a check in the box, paying your kids according to their efforts will teach them that money truly is earned.<br><br>

3. Teach them about advertising and marketing…or at least enough to not get duped by every KFC and GAP commercial that comes along.  <br><br>

4. We are never too young to start giving back – teach your kids the value of donating to (WORTHY) causes.  Let them choose the cause so they get the full intrinsic reward that comes from donating to something they believe strongly in.  Kids may not realize that money can be used for anything other than buying things…but the best money is spent on helping out a cause that you love!<br><br>

5. Teach your kids about debt BEFORE they get over their head in it.  When kids turn 18, they will be bombarded by credit card offers.  I remember that time quite well because it was the start of the debt that would follow me around for years.  I was so excited that people were giving me free money!  How awesome was that?  It wasn’t until years later when the “free money” that I never gave back to the credit card companies kept me from getting a car or an apartment that I realized my mistake.  Teach your kids about credit and debt before they have to learn on their own.  <br><br>
