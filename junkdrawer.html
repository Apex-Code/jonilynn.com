            <h2 class = "text-center header">How the Worst in Life Can Bring Out the Best in You<br />
            <!-- <h2 class = "text-center header">That one follow up to the lead in...</h2><br> -->
           
            <p class="intro text-left">It’s interesting for me to look back and see how far I’ve come with my level of resiliency over the last ten years since I became an “adult”.  The fact that I experienced so many traumatic experiences that nearly destroyed me early on, is exactly why I became the resilient person I am today.  Recognizing that bad experiences were likely to keep coming throughout the rest of my life (and seeing no indication that they would ever stop), it became a matter of survival: adapt or die.  Not having any natural resiliency strengths to lean on, I learned to develop them over time.<br><br>
One example of my poor resiliency skills in the past happened when I was 20 years old.  My gram (grandmother) was my best friend since the day I was born and I saw her more as a “mom” than my biological mother. <br><br>
She died in a house fire one night in 2007, a night when I was supposed to be there with her and wasn’t.  She was 74 so, obviously, I didn’t expect her to live forever, but I also didn’t expect to lose her so suddenly or in such a horrifically violent manner.  I felt like she deserved more years in the life she loved and a better, more peaceful death when it was her time.  I was angry and couldn’t accept this sudden change.  I lost all sight of rational thought and allowed myself to fall completely down the rabbit hole of destructive thoughts and behavior.<br><br>
At the time, I had no other support network outside of the very person who I’d just lost.  I was also struggling with depression and a related drug addiction due to other traumatic experiences that had happened in the 5 years prior to that.  I had no positive view of the future or inner direction and I lost any tattered shred of spirituality that I had still been clinging to previously.<br><br>
My resistance to the change lasted 6 years and I fought HARD to stay in that dark place.  Eventually, though, I got tired of being sad and angry…and stuck.  I started letting people back into my life and rebuilding relationships with others (some positive, some not, but the ratio started leaning more heavily towards positive with time).  I started finding things to be positive about in my life, my future and myself.  Most importantly, I started remembering and honoring my grandmother’s spirit.  Rather than being sad for the loss of her life, I started to live every day as a tribute to her memory.<br><br>
When I look back at the first 30 years of my life, this event was definitely one of two defining moments for me, and I credit them both with making me the resilient person I am today.  As a result, I am much more confident about my ability to handle setbacks in the future.  I figure that I’ve already experienced a few of the worst setbacks a person can possibly face in life and <strong>I survived</strong> (even when I thought I couldn’t possibly).  <br><br>
Anything that gets thrown at me from here on out will either be just as bad or nowhere near as bad…and I know that I can handle it either way.<br><br><br><br>
